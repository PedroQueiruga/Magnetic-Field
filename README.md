# Magnetic_Field
Code to simulate the trajectory of a proton in a magnetic field

This code presents a simulation of the magnetic field trajectory in 3 possible situations, uniform field, variable field and dipole field. May also choose to consider working with relativity or the galactic field.

The plot2 and graph_from_data files are used to plot the datasets obtained with the main code
